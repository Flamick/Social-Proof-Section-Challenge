This is my solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

In this challenge I got to use a lot of grid and flexbox for positioning and honestly I learned quite a bit about grid. It's something I haven't really used much up to this point and it was interesting to make a layout using it.
